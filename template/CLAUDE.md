## Key Operating Rules

1. **Always check INDEX.md first** before searching for files
2. Use `/add-finding` to document all new research
3. All findings must include: date, source, confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
4. Citation style: [Chicago/APA/MLA - Set your preference in directions/methodology.md]
5. Update INDEX.md after adding/modifying research (use `/refresh-index`)
6. Cross-reference related topics when connections emerge

## Core Principles

- **Document Everything**: Every finding, source, and insight gets recorded
- **Maintain Context**: INDEX.md keeps the project navigable
- **Cross-Reference**: Link related topics for holistic understanding
- **Iterative Refinement**: Research builds progressively over time
