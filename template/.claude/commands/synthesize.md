Generate a synthesis report for topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Synthesis Process

1. **Gather Information**
   - Read all files in `research/{topic}/`
   - Note cross-references to other topics
   - Check for related topics in indexes

2. **Analyze Content**
   - Identify main themes
   - Group related findings
   - Note contradictions or uncertainties
   - Assess confidence levels
   - Identify gaps in research

3. **Create Synthesis Document**

   Structure:
   ```markdown
   # Research Synthesis: [Topic]
   **Date**: [Current date]
   **Scope**: [What this synthesis covers]

   ## Executive Summary
   [2-3 paragraph overview of key findings]

   ## Key Findings
   [Organized by theme, with confidence levels]

   ## Evidence Analysis
   [Strength of evidence, source quality]

   ## Contradictions & Uncertainties
   [Areas of disagreement or unclear findings]

   ## Research Gaps
   [What's missing, what needs further study]

   ## Implications
   [What this means, how it relates to goals]

   ## Recommendations
   [Next steps, future research directions]

   ## Sources
   [Key sources consulted]
   ```

4. **Save Synthesis**
   - Save to `research/{topic}/synthesis-[date].md`
   - Update INDEX.md to include synthesis document in the topic entry

5. **Present Summary**
   - Provide the executive summary
   - Highlight most important insights
   - Suggest next actions
