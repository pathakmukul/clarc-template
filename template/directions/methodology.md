# Research Methodology

## Research Approach

### Framework
[Your overall approach - systematic review, exploratory, mixed methods, etc.]

### Process
1. Identify research questions and topics
2. Gather sources and evaluate credibility
3. Document findings with proper citations
4. Cross-reference related topics
5. Synthesize insights periodically
6. Generate reports as needed

## Source Evaluation Criteria

### Inclusion Criteria
- Relevant to research questions
- From credible sources
- Recent enough to be current (adjust based on topic)
- Methodology is sound

### Exclusion Criteria
- Clearly biased or promotional content
- Unverified claims without sources
- Outdated information (when more recent sources exist)
- Low-quality or unreliable sources

## Citation Standards

**Style Guide**: [APA/Chicago/MLA - Choose your preference]

**Required Information**:
- Author(s)
- Publication date
- Title
- Publication venue
- DOI/URL
- Access date (for web sources)

## Source Credibility Hierarchy

Use this hierarchy when evaluating sources:

1. **Peer-reviewed academic papers** - Highest credibility
2. **Academic books and textbooks** - High credibility
3. **Reputable news sources and reports** - Medium-high credibility
4. **Blog posts and opinion pieces** - Use cautiously, verify claims

## Quality Control

### Verification Process
- Cross-check facts across multiple sources
- Verify author credentials for key claims
- Check publication dates and relevance
- Note any potential biases

### Confidence Assessment

Every finding must be assigned a confidence level:

- **High**: Multiple peer-reviewed sources, consistent findings, strong methodology
- **Medium**: Single reliable source OR multiple informal sources in agreement
- **Low**: Preliminary findings, single informal source, needs verification

### Cross-Referencing Rules

- Link topics when they share concepts or findings
- Note contradictions between sources explicitly
- Track evolution of ideas across topics
- Update INDEX.md when cross-references are established

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming
- Topics: lowercase-with-hyphens (e.g., machine-learning)
- Reports: descriptive-title-YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Synthesis: synthesis-YYYY-MM-DD.md

### Content Structure
- Headers: Use markdown hierarchy (##, ###)
- Findings: Include date, source, confidence level
- Cross-references: Link explicitly between related topics

## Review & Update Cycle

- **Daily**: Add new findings, update INDEX.md as research progresses
- **Weekly**: Review todo list, run `/refresh-index`, update Current Research State in CLAUDE.md
- **Monthly**: Assess goals, consolidate findings, update methodology if needed

## Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- Run `/refresh-index` to update INDEX.md
- Review `todo/active.md` and reprioritize tasks
- Update "Current Research State" in CLAUDE.md
- Archive completed research

### Monthly
- Verify all citations are complete and properly formatted
- Check for outdated information
- Consolidate duplicate findings
- Update methodology if research approach has evolved
